// HOW TO USE?
// Implement longSingal() and shortSignal() to return true if your entered a long/short position right away or
// if their is still one open.
// Example Image: https://image.xtracode.ws/i/PD0NGANmrwWO7kxj/662648a0b71c27f5b62ad0446604ab14
// Green line => Highest price since last entry, Red line => Trailing Stop

// ## Trailing Stop configuration
trailStopPercentage = input(5,"Trailing Stop %")/100

// ## Correction of the exit order if the current candle high is above our position entry (trailing stop simulation)
// condition is only true if we're already LONG and the current candle high is above our avg entry
condition = longSignal() and (high > strategy.position_avg_price)

// ## Save the highest price since our last entry position
highest = na
highest := (condition) ? max(max(nz(highest[1]), strategy.position_avg_price), high) : (shortSignal()) ? strategy.position_avg_price : highest[1]
trailingStopPrice = highest - (highest * trailStopPercentage)

// ## Plot highest price since last entry
plot(trailingStopPrice, title="Trailing Stop Price", color=yellow)
// ## Plot Trailing Stop line
plot(highest, title="Highes Price Since Going Long", color=green)

// ## Cancel all exit orders, if we're LONG and the current candle high is the highest sinc our last long entry
strategy.cancel_all(condition)
// ## Place a new exit order -trailStopPercentage under the high
strategy.exit("Trailing Stop", "Long", stop = trailingStopPrice, when = condition)
